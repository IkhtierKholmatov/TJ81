To be checked for cervical cancer, a woman is asked to lie on her back with her legs apart. Then the healthcare worker will use a brush or swab to collect a sample from inside her. The sample is sent to a laboratory for testing. This test is called a Pap smear or HPV test. Another method is called a VIA or Visual Inspection with Acetic Acid. In this test, the healthcare worker puts vinegar on the cervix to see if there is a reaction.</p>

So, it is fine if your child is not able to do all the things I am going to ask you about. You can let me know if you have any doubts about what answer to give.</p>
